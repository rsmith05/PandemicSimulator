     * age group and preexisting conditions. 0-1 double.
     * @param susceptibilities A boolean array of which age groups (children, adults, seniors) are more susceptible to the disease than others. Multiple are possible (i.e. children and seniors)
     * @param incubation The number of days which the virus incubates in an infected person. The person is able to spread the
     * disease in this time, but isn't able to die during this time.
     * @param resistance The number of days that the person "feels symptoms" and is able to die. Every day of this period, they
     * have a chance of death based on mortality, age and preexisting conditions. If they survive these many days, they are 
     * considered recovered and cannot be infected again.
